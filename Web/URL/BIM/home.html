	<p>This is home.<br>
	Good homes need to be mostly ordinary, but not only so. 
	This is not about the home as a building, but rather the
	house as a unit assembled together with others. 
	Contemporary neighbourhoods, with their homogeneity and 
	emphasis on privacy, snuff out the need for us to experience difference as something affirming.
